a smart home control web application based on Java WebSockets




WebSocket provides an alternative to this limitation by providing bi-directional, full-duplex, real-time, client/server communications. The server can send data to the client at any time. Because WebSocket runs over TCP, it also reduces the overhead of each message. WebSocket also provides greater scalability for message-intensive applications because only one connection per client is used (whereas HTTP creates one request per message). Finally, WebSocket is part of Java EE 7, so you can use other technologies in the Java EE 7 stack.
